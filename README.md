# TicTacToegame.py
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game made in Python that runs in the terminal.
You can play against another player or against the computer.
I built this project to practice Python basics like lists, functions, loops, and conditional statements.

WHAT THE PROGRAM DOES?
Lets you choose between:
-Player vs Player
-Player vs Computer

-Uses a 3×3 board with positions from A1 to C3
-Checks for wins across rows, columns, and diagonals
-Ends the game if someone wins or if it’s a draw
-The computer chooses a random available move

HOW TO RUN THE GAME
-Make sure Python 3 is installed
-Save the file as tic_tac_toe.py
-Open your terminal or command prompt

Run:
python tic_tac_toe.py
How to play
Choose a game mode by entering 1 or 2
Enter positions like A1, B2, or C3
If a position is taken or invalid, you’ll be asked to try again
The game stops when someone wins or the board is full

How it works (short)
The board is stored as a 2D list
Player inputs are mapped to board positions
A function checks if a player has won
In computer mode, the computer randomly picks from free spaces

Why I made this
This project helped me understand:
Working with 2D lists
Writing and using functions
Validating user input
Basic game logic in Python
Possible upgrades
Smarter computer moves
Option to replay the game
A GUI version using Tkinter
